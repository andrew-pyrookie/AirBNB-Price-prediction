# AirBNB-Price-prediction

## Problem Statement

Airbnb hosts often struggle to set competitive yet profitable prices for their listings. Static pricing fails to account for real-time market demand, local events, seasonality, competitor pricing, or guest preferences. Incorrect pricing leads to lost revenue (underpricing) or vacant listings (overpricing). Existing tools like Airbnb’s Smart Pricing are basic, lack transparency, and don’t fully leverage modern data or AI capabilities.

## Proposed Solution: "AirPrice Pro"

AirPrice Pro is a subscription-based, AI-powered dynamic pricing platform designed for Airbnb hosts. It predicts optimal listing prices in real-time by analyzing historical data, market trends, and external factors (e.g., local events, weather, competitor listings). The system offers actionable insights, automates price adjustments, and integrates with Airbnb’s API for seamless updates. It solves the problem of suboptimal pricing, maximizes revenue, and saves hosts time.

## Market Application

- **Target Audience**: Airbnb hosts (individuals and property managers), particularly in competitive markets like NYC, LA, or London.
- **Value Proposition**: Increase occupancy rates and revenue by 15-30% through data-driven pricing.
- **Monetization**: 
  - Subscription model (e.g., $10/month for individual hosts, $50/month for property managers with multiple listings)
  - Premium features (e.g., competitor analysis, guest demand forecasting)
